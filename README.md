# Personal Blog Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is my personal blog portfolio website built with GatsbyJS, SCSS, and deployed to Vercel. I built it with a minimalistic approach in mind. It's entirely text based.

I use it to write about things that interest me and add quotes that have resonated with me.
