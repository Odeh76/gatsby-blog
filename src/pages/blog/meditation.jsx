        <p>Much of what I will write in this post will be based on my personal experience and what I have gleaned from other people who spoken about it and shared their own experiences. In essence, all meditation techniques are concentration techniques. I've heard that there are four different states that our minds tend to exist in. The first one being free association. This is essentially where you walk down the street and you are freely associating what you see with whatever is already in your mind. This can be seeing a dog and being reminded of a dog that you used to have, or you pass someone and they remind you of someone you used to know, or you see a crow fly by and it reminds you of some random fact you know about crows. It's pretty unbounded and can really be anything. After free association, is contemplation. Contemplation is essentially directing your mind to thinking about one topic. This is also done in a somewhat broad sense. I have heard that scientists are essentially in contemplation when thinking about some topic. It could also be an author trying to think about ideas related to their novel or whatever piece they are writing about. After contemplation is concentration, which is directing your mind and attention to just one thing. This could be solving some difficult mathematical problem, driving intensely on a curve, or something that grips your attention in a full way. The last state beyond concentration is meditation. This is when whatever you were concentrated on or your focal point gets dropped and there really is just nothing. Almost all meditation techniques are concentration techniques.</p>
        <p>Meditation truly is a remarkable habit for you to cultivate. You are simply a better person when you do it. You are more focused, more disciplined, more relaxed, and at peace. The more you do it, the better your brain will be. Reading the book altered traits has helped in understanding some of the scientific benefits that come from meditation. One line that stuck with me from that book is that meditation is like exercise for your brain, and arguably as many benefits. The benefits of exercise are endless. It is perhaps the most effective and significant habit any human being can have, in terms of maintaining and improving their health. This permeates across physical, mental, and emotional. Meditation is sort of the same. It helps your brain physically, helps calm your mind, and helps work through much of the emotional baggage that gets accumulated every day in this life. By sitting down and meditating, you are creating a better life for yourself.

        <p>Here are some of the more palpable benefits that you experience when meditating consistently:</p>

        </ol>
        <p>These are just some of the benefits off the top of my head that I have experienced first-hand. This is not counting all the physiological, physical, visceral benefits that are happening. The list of those benefits and the positive impact meditation has on them is endless. And the cool thing is there doesn’t seem to be any downside. Also, it’s free. And the more you do it, the more benefits you get.</p>
        <p>It’s a rare thing in life to come across something that is almost entirely a net positive, improves your life in such a drastic, positive way, costs you nothing, and all around just makes you a better human being. So when you find something like that, it’s worth practicing more of it and preserving it. It’s worth being grateful for. It’s worth appreciating the privilege of being able to meditate. So continue to do and cultivate this habit. Continue to enjoy the benefits of it. The rewards are endless.</p>
