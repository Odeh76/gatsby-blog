        <h6 className='mb-2'>Didgeridoo</h6>
        <p>Originating in Australia, the Didgeridoo is one of the oldest wind instruments in history.</p>
        <p>There are no reliable sources of the exact age of the didgeridoo. However, some of the oldest records of playing the didgeridoo date back 1500 years in the form of old Northern Territory cave and rock paintings.</p>
        <p>I first discovered the didgeridoo through a friend of mine who had one. One day while hanging out at Dolores Park in San Francisco, my friend walked over with a long stick tied behind his back, sat down, greeted us, removed this mysterious item from his back and laid it down. Curious, I asked what it was. He told me it's called a didge, short for didgeridoo. I was enamored by it's rather long and simple build. I asked him what sound it makes. He grabbed it and played one long note. The didgeridoo only plays one note, but it has various tone colors that result from characteristic pitches--called formants--overlaying the fundamental note. I was gripped by the powerful sound it made.</p>
        <p>Upon observing my interest, my friend handed it to me and said "pucker your lips and blow into it". Positively curious, I grabbed it, puckered my lips and blew. It sounded okay. Not nearly as good as his. "Not bad" he said, "but try to close the gap completely with your lips". I tried again, and let out a powerful note that I played until I ran out of breath. My friend complimented my lung capacity. Never knew this about myself, but apparently I have good lung capacity. &#128540;</p>
        <p>I tried a bunch more times and the sound got better and better. The didgeridoo also creates a vibration that feels quite good. And focusing on the note, felt like another concentration meditation technique.</p>
